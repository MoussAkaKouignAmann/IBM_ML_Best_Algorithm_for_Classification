# 05-IBM_ML_Best_Algorithm_for_Classification
Use different Machine Learning algorithms to classify whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the different algorithms. 
and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

Convert to date time object,
Data visualization and pre-processing,
Feature selection/extraction,
Convert Categorical features to numerical values,
One Hot Encoding,
Normalize Data,
K Nearest Neighbor(KNN),
Decision Tree,
Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression,
Model Evaluation using jaccard_similarity_score and F1_score,

Report shows that SVM is the best model to use for this classifier.
